# Arbitrage-Automator
The goal of the arbitrage automator is to automate the "shopping around" aspect of sportsbook odds.  When shopping is complete, then calculations are performed to determine if there are any events from our shopping that are "arbitrage-able".  

Abritage-able:  "Can we wager on all possible outcomes and have a minimum payout gretaer than the sum of our wagers?"
